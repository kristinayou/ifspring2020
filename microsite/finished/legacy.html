		<h2>LEGACY AND IMPACT</h2>
		<h3>The New Yorker described Sade's voice as a "grainy contralto full of air that betrays a slight ache but no agony, and values even imperfect dignity over a show of pain", a "deeply English" quality that makes categorizing the artist's voice difficult.[71] Her voice was described by the BBC as "husky and restrained" and compared to singer Billie Holiday. BBC called her songwriting "sufficiently soulful and jazzy yet poppy, funky yet easy listening, to appeal to fans of all those genres."[72] Sade has been called a "pop star".[71] With the musicians in her band, Sade, The New Yorker wrote, "created one of the most profitable catalogues in pop"; the band's "easy" sound backing songs "exploring the heavier lifting inside love: commitment, consistency, friendship."[71] Her success has been attributed to a combination of her unique beauty, seemingly indefinable origins, and mysterious persona.[71]

		Sade's work has influenced and been recognized by many singers and hip hop artists. Rapper Rakim of Eric B. & Rakim stated he grew up listening to Sade's music and was influenced by her voice and style. Rakim has also referenced Sade's song "Smooth Operator" in his rap song "Paid in Full" (1987).[73] Talib Kweli stated he learned about precision from Sade due to her performance of Love Deluxe in its entirety at Madison Square Garden.[73] Rapper Missy Elliott cited Sade's performance of "Smooth Operator" as one of her favourites. Hip hop group Souls of Mischief stated they grew up listening to Sade's music.[73] Hip hop group Tanya Morgan also described Sade as one of their favorite artists.[73] Other rappers to recognize Sade include the former rap-duo of Clipse – Malice and Pusha.[73] In reaction to the newly released album Soldier of Love, rapper Kanye West wrote, "This is why i still have a blog. To be a part of moments like this ... new Sade ... How much better this ... than everything else?".[73] Rapper Rick Ross stated in an interview that "People may know my infatuation with Sade. There's never been a bad Sade track. I love all different sides."[74]

		American singer Beyoncé called Sade's music a "true friend" and an inspiration.[75] The late singer Aaliyah said that she admired Sade because "she stays true to her style no matter what... she's an amazing artist, an amazing performer... and I absolutely love her."[76] American R&B singer Brandy has cited Sade as one of her major vocal influences.<h3>

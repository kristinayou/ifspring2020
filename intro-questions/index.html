			<li>My name is Kristina You, I am a Senior majoring in 
			<em>Communication Design</em>. </li>
			<br>
			<br>
			<li>I previously was enrolled in the course but did not complete it so I re-enrolled. I also think that it is useful to know the basic information to build a website, especially when working with UI/UX designers or building my own website.</li>
			<br>
			<br>
			<li>I only have a tiny bit of experience with HTML and CSS from previously taking this class for a short amount of time but I don't have any other experience besides that.</li>
			<br>
			<br>
			<li>I hope to get a better sense of knowledge about designing for the screen and also be able to design my own portfolio site.</li>
			<br>
			<br>
			<li>I think that people interact with a screen differently than they do with something physical, so I think that clarity of hierarchy seems to be more important for web design.</li>
			<br>

			<li>
				<a href="https://www.outofthedark.xyz/"> Out of the Dark </a>
				<br>
				<br>
				I think that the website for Out of the Dark type foundry has a website that communicates well with its audience because the website is really interactive and responsive in the way that it displays each typeface in use.

			</li>
			<br>
			<br>
			<li>
				<a href="https://i-d.vice.com/en_us"> ID Magazine </a>
				<br>
				<br>
				I think that the website for ID Magazine works well because the hierarchy of information is very clear and the navigation through the site is very accessible for the user.

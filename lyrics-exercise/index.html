		Every time I think of you
		<br>
		I feel shot right through with a bolt of blue
		<br>
		It's no problem of mine
		<br>
		But it's a problem I find
		<br>
		Living a life that I can't leave behind
		<br>
		But there's no sense in telling me
		<br>
		The wisdom of the fool won't set you free
		<br>
		But that's the way that it goes
		<br>
		And it's what nobody knows
		<br>
		Well every day my confusion grows
		<br>
		<br>
		Every time I see you falling
		<br>
		I get down on my knees and pray
		<br>
		I'm waiting for that final moment
		<br>
		You say the words that I can't say
		<br>
		<br>
		I feel fine and I feel good
		<br>
		I'm feeling like I never should
		<br>
		Whenever I get this way
		<br>
		I just don't know what to say
		<br>
		Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday
		<br>
		I'm not sure what this could mean
		<br>
		I don't think you're what you seem
		<br>
		I do admit to myself
		<br>
		That if I hurt someone else
		<br>
		Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be
		<br>
		<br>
		Every time I see you falling
		<br>
		I get down on my knees and pray
		<br>
		I'm waiting for that final moment
		<br>
		You say the words that I can't say
		<br>
		<br>
		Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
		<br>
		Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
		<br>
		Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
		<br>
		<br>

			Every time I think of you
			<br>
			I feel shot right through with a bolt of blue
			<br>
			It's no problem of mine
			<br>
			But it's a problem I find
			<br>
			Living a life that I can't leave behind
			<br>
			But there's no sense in telling me
			<br>
			The wisdom of the fool won't set you free
			<br>
			But that's the way that it goes
			<br>
			And it's what nobody knows
			<br>
			Well every day my confusion grows

		<section id="second">
			Every time I see you falling
			<br>
			I get down on my knees and pray
			<br>
			I'm waiting for that final moment
			<br>
			You say the words that I can't say
		</section>

		<section id="third">
			I feel fine and I feel good
			<br>
			I'm feeling like I never should
			<br>
			Whenever I get this way
			<br>
			I just don't know what to say
			<br>
			Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday
			<br>
			I'm not sure what this could mean
			<br>
			I don't think you're what you seem
			<br>
			I do admit to myself
			<br>
			That if I hurt someone else
			<br>
			Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be
